🎓 Unlocking the Path to Success: Predicting Graduate Admissions 🚀

I am thrilled to share that as part of my INTERNSAVY internship Task 1, I have successfully completed an exciting data analysis project focused on predicting Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective. 🎓✨

📈 Leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes crucial factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, statements of purpose (SOP), letters of recommendation (LOR), and more, I embarked on a journey to uncover valuable insights and build accurate prediction models.

🔍 Here's an overview of my approach and key findings:

1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis: I commenced the project by thoroughly exploring the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying any missing values. This initial step provided me with a holistic understanding of the data.

2️⃣ Visualizing the Data: To gain deeper insights into the relationships between various variables, I created a series of informative visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. From distribution plots and box plots to scatter plots, I visually captured the essence of the data.

3️⃣ Model Training: After preprocessing the dataset, which involved feature scaling using MinMaxScaler, I divided the data into training and testing sets. Subsequently, I implemented various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting to construct robust prediction models.

4️⃣ Model Evaluation: To gauge the performance of each model, I utilized accuracy scores and classification reports. These metrics provided valuable insights into the models' predictive capabilities, effectively highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

🎯 Results and Key Findings:

📊 Logistic Regression: Achieved an impressive accuracy of 87.5% in predicting graduate admissions.

🌳 Decision Trees: Demonstrated a strong predictive power with an accuracy of 86.25% in predicting graduate admissions.

🌿 Random Forests: Emerged as the top performer, boasting an outstanding accuracy of 91.25% in predicting graduate admissions.

⚡️ Support Vector Machines (SVM): Showcased a commendable accuracy of 87.5% in predicting graduate admissions.

🚀 Gradient Boosting: Equally impressive, yielding an accuracy of 91.25% in predicting graduate admissions.

💼 Conclusion and Implications:

✅ These results underscore the potential of classification techniques in accurately predicting graduate admissions. By leveraging essential factors such as test scores, university ratings, and application materials like SOP and LOR, we can provide aspiring graduate students with invaluable insights.

🎓 Students can utilize these predictions to assess their chances of admission, identify areas for improvement, and develop a more strategic approach to the application process.

👨‍🎓👩‍🎓 Academic institutions can also benefit from this predictive analysis by gaining deeper insights into the factors that contribute to successful admissions. This knowledge can assist in refining selection criteria and streamlining the admissions process.

🌟 The future of graduate admissions lies in data-driven insights, and I am honored to have completed this INTERNSAVY internship Task 1.
